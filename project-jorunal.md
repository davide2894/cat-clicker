Store clicks for each cat, so that when I switch back to it I can see saved clicks.
Mmmm localstorage seems ideal. 

Like 6 vars, one for each cat.

n in cat area is cat's n. then, each time I click on cat's area n updates both in list and area. And each time I switch cat I want to take its current n of clicks.

Javascript done. It was all about referencing and using localStorage to save clicks for each cat.
